# Contacts App

The `Contacts` Datapad app allows players to view data about the people they've met during their adventures across the Galaxy.

## Bugs

Clicking on the scroll-bar deselects the currently selected contact.

## TODO

-   Handle droids differently from organics (gender, etc.)
-   Image pop-out
-   Card tabs: Probably split current one into "basic data" and "affiliations". Add notes, etc.
-   Filter + search
    -   Add filtered server queries
-   Affiliation links (link to other contacts, locations, etc.?)
