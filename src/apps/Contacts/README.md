# Contacts App

The `Contacts` Datapad app allows players to view data about the people they've met during their adventures across the Galaxy.

## TODO

-   Card tabs: Probably split current one into "basic data" and "affiliations". Add notes, etc.
-   Filter + search
    -   Add filtered server queries
-   Affiliation links (link to other contacts, locations, etc.?)
