# Datapad

TODO: Datapad docs.

## Galaxy Map

The `Galaxy Map` Datapad app allows players to navigate the Galaxy at large.

It is intended to simulate the virtual map they would doubtless have on their personal datapads.

Implemented by embedding [Star Wars Galaxy Map](http://www.swgalaxymap.com/).

## Shops

The `Shops` Datapad app allows players to view available inventory for the shops aboard Centran Base, and make purchases of available items.
